# CAD-Viewer

[**üåê Live Demo**](https://mlight-lee.github.io/cad-viewer/)

CAD-Viewer is a **high-performance**, modern, web-based CAD editor inspired by AutoCAD. It enables users to view and edit DWG/DXF files directly in the browser with exceptional rendering speed and smooth interactions, supporting both offline and online workflows. The project is modular and designed for seamless integration with other applications.

## Features

- **High-performance** viewing of large DWG/DXF files with smooth 60+ FPS rendering
- Modular architecture for easy integration
- Offline and online editing workflows
- THREE.js 3D rendering engines with advanced optimization techniques
- Designed for extensibility and integration with platforms like CMS, Notion, and WeChat

## Performance

CAD-Viewer is engineered for **exceptional performance** and can handle very large DXF/DWG files while maintaining high frame rates. It employs multiple advanced rendering technologies to optimize performance:

- **Custom Shader Materials**: Uses GPU-accelerated shader materials to render complex line types and hatch fill patterns efficiently
- **Geometry Batching**: Merges points, lines, and areas with the same material to dramatically reduce draw calls
- **Instanced Rendering**: Optimizes rendering of repeated geometries through instancing techniques
- **Buffer Geometry Optimization**: Efficient memory management and geometry merging for reduced GPU overhead
- **Material Caching**: Reuses materials across similar entities to minimize state changes
- **WebGL Optimization**: Leverages modern WebGL features for hardware-accelerated rendering

These optimizations enable CAD-Viewer to smoothly render complex CAD drawings with thousands of entities while maintaining responsive user interactions.

## Roadmap

To achieve the final goal, the following milestones are defined:

- [x] **DWG/DXF Viewer**: Create an offline web viewer for DWG/DXF files.
- [ ] **Integration**: Integrate the DWG/DXF viewer into other applications or frameworks (e.g., CMS, Notion, OpenLayers).
- [ ] **WeChat App**: Develop a WeChat app to display DWG/DXF files within WeChat.
- [ ] **Offline CAD Editor**: Build an offline CAD editor that allows users to modify DWG/DXF files in the browser and store changes locally.
- [ ] **Online CAD Editor**: Add backend support to enable users to store changes to DXF/DWG files in the cloud.

## Architecture

CAD-Viewer is organized into several subpackages, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system:

- **cad-viewer**: Main Vue 3 component and frontend application, including UI components, dialogs, toolbars, state management, and integration with rendering engines.
- **cad-simple-viewer**: Core logic for document management, command handling, and integration between UI and rendering engines. Framework-agnostic and UI-free (canvas only).
- **svg-renderer**: Renders DWG/DXF entities as SVG graphics for exporting and scalable 2D output.
- **three-renderer**: Uses THREE.js to render DWG/DXF entities as interactive 2D/3D graphics with advanced visualization and custom shaders.
- **cad-viewer-example**: Example application demonstrating how to use the `cad-viewer` component in a real project.
