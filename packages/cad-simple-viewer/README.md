# CAD Simple Viewer

This package provides the **high-performance** core components of a CAD viewer such as document management, command handling, and collaboration between the UI and rendering engines. It's designed for optimal performance when handling large CAD files.

This module doesn't depend on any UI framework and doesn't provide any UI except canvas. If you want to integrate a high-performance CAD viewer into a web application with your own UI, this module is the correct choice.

## Key Features
- Document management optimized for large files
- Efficient command stack and undo/redo operations
- Optimized integration with rendering engines
- Performance-focused settings and context management
- Framework-agnostic design for maximum flexibility

## When Should You Choose cad-simple-viewer?

Use `cad-simple-viewer` if you need **core CAD logic only** (document management, command stack, rendering engine integration) without any UI framework dependencies. This package is ideal if:

- You want to build your **own custom UI** or integrate CAD functionality into a non-Vue or non-web environment.
- You require maximum flexibility and performance for handling large CAD files, and plan to connect the logic to your own rendering or UI layer.
- You want a framework-agnostic solution that provides only the essential CAD operations and canvas rendering.

**Recommended for:** Custom integrations, headless CAD processing, or advanced users building highly tailored CAD solutions.

## Directory Structure (partial)

## Usage
Entry point: `src/app/index.ts`. Used by the main application to manage documents and commands.

## Role in MLightCAD
This package acts as the core logic layer, connecting the frontend UI with the rendering engines and managing all document-related operations.
