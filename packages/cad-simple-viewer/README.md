# CAD Simple Viewer

This package provides the **high-performance** core components of a CAD viewer such as document management, command handling, and collaboration between the UI and rendering engines. It's designed for optimal performance when handling large CAD files.

This module doesn't depend on any UI framework and doesn't provide any UI except canvas. If you want to integrate a high-performance CAD viewer into a web application with your own UI, this module is the correct choice.

## Key Features
- Document management optimized for large files
- Efficient command stack and undo/redo operations
- Optimized integration with rendering engines
- Performance-focused settings and context management
- Framework-agnostic design for maximum flexibility


## Directory Structure (partial)
- `src/app/` – Document/context management, settings
- `src/command/` – Command implementations (open, zoom, select, etc.)
- `src/editor/` – Command stack, input handling, global functions
- `src/view/` – Layout and scene management
- `src/util/` – Utilities

## Usage
Entry point: `src/app/index.ts`. Used by the main application to manage documents and commands.

## Role in MLightCAD
This package acts as the core logic layer, connecting the frontend UI with the rendering engines and managing all document-related operations.
