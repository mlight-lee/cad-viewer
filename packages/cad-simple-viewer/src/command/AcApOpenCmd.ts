/**
 * Command to open a CAD file.
 * 
 * This command triggers the file opening workflow by emitting an 'open-file' event
 * on the global event bus. The actual file opening logic is handled by other
 * components listening for this event (typically the UI layer).
 * 
 * The command follows the standard CAD pattern where the command itself is lightweight
 * and delegates the actual work to specialized handlers.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const openCommand = new AcApOpenCmd();
 * openCommand.globalName = 'OPEN';
 * openCommand.localName = 'Open File';
 * 
 * // Trigger the command
 * openCommand.trigger(docManager.context);
 * 
 * // The command will emit 'open-file' event for UI components to handle
 * ```
