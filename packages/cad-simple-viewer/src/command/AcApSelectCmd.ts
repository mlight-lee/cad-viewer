/**
 * Command for enabling selection mode in the CAD viewer.
 * 
 * This command switches the view to selection mode, allowing users to
 * select CAD entities by clicking on them. When executed, it:
 * - Sets the view mode to SELECTION
 * - Changes the cursor to a crosshair for precise selection
 * 
 * In selection mode, users can click on entities to select them,
 * which will add them to the selection set and typically show
 * grip points for manipulation.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const selectCmd = new AcApSelectCmd();
 * selectCmd.execute(context); // Enables selection mode
 * ```
