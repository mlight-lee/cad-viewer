/**
 * Command to zoom the view to fit all visible entities.
 * 
 * This command adjusts the view's zoom level and position to show all
 * visible entities in the current drawing within the viewport. It's
 * equivalent to the "Zoom Extents" or "Fit to Window" functionality
 * found in most CAD applications.
 * 
 * The command calculates the bounding box of all visible entities and
 * adjusts the camera to show them all with appropriate padding.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const zoomCommand = new AcApZoomCmd();
 * zoomCommand.globalName = 'ZOOM';
 * zoomCommand.localName = 'Zoom to Fit';
 * 
 * // Execute the command to fit all entities in view
 * zoomCommand.trigger(docManager.context);
 * ```

   * and zoom level to display all visible entities within the viewport.
   *
