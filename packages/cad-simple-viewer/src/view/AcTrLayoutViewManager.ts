/**
 * Manages multiple layout views and coordinates active layout switching.
 * 
 * This class serves as a central coordinator for all layout views in the CAD viewer.
 * It handles:
 * - Managing a collection of layout views indexed by their block table record IDs
 * - Tracking and switching the active layout
 * - Coordinating rendering operations across layout views
 * - Managing view lifecycle (resize, enable/disable)
 * 
 * The layout view manager ensures that only one layout is active at a time while
 * maintaining the state of all layouts for quick switching. It provides a unified
 * interface for layout operations regardless of which specific layout is active.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const manager = new AcTrLayoutViewManager();
 * manager.add(layoutView);
 * manager.activeLayoutBtrId = 'layout1';
 * manager.render(scene);
 * ```
